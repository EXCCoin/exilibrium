StakeShuffle requires two dedicated wallet accounts - a "mixed" account and an
"unmixed" account.

When the account mixer is activated, ExchangeCoin will be transferred from the unmixed
account into the mixed account.

Mix transactions are created every 20 minutes, but only if enough parties are
available to participate in the mix.
It can take multiple mix transactions for your full unmixed balance to be mixed.

**It is important that Exilibrium is not closed while the mixer is active.**

Once a Exilibrium wallet has enabled privacy, ExchangeCoin should only be sent from
the mixed account.
Sending from other accounts can compromise your privacy by linking your mixed
ExchangeCoin to your unmixed ExchangeCoin.
