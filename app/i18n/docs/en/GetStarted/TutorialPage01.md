# What is ExchangeCoin Blockchain?

At ExchangeCoin’s heart is an ever growing list of records shared globally across a decentralized ledger; this is ExchangeCoin’s blockchain.

The blockchain holds all of ExchangeCoin’s transactional data and uses an innovative **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)/Proof-of-Work (PoW) system** to validate transactions and keep the network secure.

This hybrid system mitigates weaknesses that PoS and PoW have individually. Furthermore it forms the cornerstone for **smart governance** of the project.

Widespread participation in **staking (PoS)** and **mining (PoW)** helps to protect the neutrality of the network and rewards the participants with newly generated EXCC from the block reward.
